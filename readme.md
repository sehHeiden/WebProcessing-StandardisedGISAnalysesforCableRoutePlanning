# Web Processing - Standardized Analyses for Cable Route Planing

Finding Cable Routes with the Least Coast Path Algorithm (Dijkstra's Algorithm on Raster)
on a web processing service (WPS).

The cost raster are calculated for with `rules2weight.py` [Documentation](/src/documentation_cost_raster_generation.md).

WPS [Documentation](/src/pywps_docu.md) is implemented with PyWPS.
